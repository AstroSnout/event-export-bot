# EventExport Discord Bot
This is a simple discord bot that works as a translator (parser) for the export strings you get from [EventExport addon](https://github.com/AstroSnout/event-export) in WoW. It will parse all of the strings obtained from it into a spreadsheet, all you need to do is paste the string or if the string is over 2000 characters (discord limti), then put the string into a file and send it to the bot.

You can DM the bot by entering [it's discord server](https://discord.gg/UWRapJ).
